       "['enius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\" he\\n     remarked with a smile. \"It\\'s a very bad definition, but it does apply\\n     to detective work.\"\\n\\n     Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres of their amateur\\n     companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They\\n     evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to\\n     realize, that Sherlock Holmes\\' smallest actions were all directed\\n     towards some definite and practical end.\\n\\n     \"What do you think of it, sir?\" they both asked.\\n\\n     \"It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to\\n     presume to help you,\" remarked my friend. \"You are doing so well now\\n     that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.\" There was a world\\n     of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \"If you will let me know how\\n     your investigations go,\" he continued, \"I shall be happy to give you\\n     any help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the\\n     constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and address?\"\\n\\n     Lestrade glanced at his note-book. \"John Rance,\" he said. \"He is off\\n     duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park\\n     Gate.\"\\n\\n     Holmes took a note of the address.\\n\\n     \"Come along, Doctor,\" he said; \"we shall go and look him up. I\\'ll\\n     tell you one thing which may help you in the case,\" he continued,\\n     turning to the two detectives. \"There has been murder done, and the\\n     murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime\\n     of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed\\n     boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim\\n     in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old\\n     shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the\\n     murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand\\n     were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may\\n     assist you.\"\\n\\n     Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\\n\\n     \"If this man was murdered, how was it done?\" asked the former.\\n\\n     \"Poison,\" said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \"One other\\n     thing, Lestrade,\" he added, turning round at the door: \"\\'Rache,\\' is\\n     the German for \\'revenge;\\' so don\\'t lose your time looking for Miss\\n     Rachel.\"\\n\\n     With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\\n     open-mouthed behind him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER IV\\n          What John Rance Had To Tell\\n\\n\\n     It was one o\\'clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\\n     Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\\n     long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take\\n     us to the address given us by Lestrade.\\n\\n     \"There is nothing like first hand evidence,\" he remarked; \"as a\\n     matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still\\n     we may as well learn all that is to be learned.\"\\n\\n     \"You amaze me, Holmes,\" said I. \"Surely you are not as sure as you\\n     pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\"\\n\\n     \"There\\'s no room for a mistake,\" he answered. \"The very first thing\\n     which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts\\n     with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had\\n     no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep\\n     impression must have been there during the night. There were the\\n     marks of the horse\\'s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far\\n     more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was\\n     a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not\\n     there at any time during the morning--I have Gregson\\'s word for\\n     that--it follows that it must have been there during the night, and,\\n     therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.\"\\n\\n     \"That seems simple enough,\" said I; \"but how about the other man\\'s\\n     height?\"\\n\\n     \"Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\\n     the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\\n     there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\\'s\\n     stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a\\n     way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his\\n     instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that\\n     writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child\\'s play.\"\\n\\n     \"And his age?\" I asked.\\n\\n     \"Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\\n     effort, he can\\'t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the\\n     breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked\\n     across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had\\n     hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply\\n     applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and\\n     deduction which I advocated in that  article. Is there anything else\\n     that puzzles you?\"\\n\\n     \"The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\" I suggested.\\n\\n     \"The writing on the wall was done with a man\\'s forefinger dipped in\\n     blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\\n     scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the\\n     man\\'s nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from\\n     the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only\\n     made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar\\n     ashes--in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I\\n     flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any\\n     known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such\\n     details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and\\n     Lestrade type.\"\\n\\n     \"And the florid face?\" I asked.\\n\\n     \"Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\\n     right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\"\\n\\n     I passed my hand over my brow. \"My head is in a whirl,\" I remarked;\\n     \"the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came\\n     these two men--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has\\n     become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another\\n     to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of\\n     the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman\\'s\\n     ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German\\n     word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible\\n     way of reconciling all these facts.\"\\n\\n     My companion smiled approvingly.\\n\\n     \"You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\"\\n     he said. \"There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite\\n     made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\\'s discovery it\\n     was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by\\n     suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a\\n     German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German\\n     fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character,\\n     so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a\\n     clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert\\n     inquiry into a wrong channel. I\\'m not going to tell you much more of\\n     the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has\\n     explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of\\n     working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary\\n     individual after all.\"\\n\\n     \"I shall never do that,\" I answered; \"you have brought detection as\\n     near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\"\\n\\n     My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest\\n     way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as\\n     sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of\\n     her beauty.\\n\\n     \"I\\'ll tell you one other thing,\" he said. \"Patent-leathers and\\n     Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\\n     together as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.\\n     When they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather,\\n     Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\\n     could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked\\n     he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length\\n     of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up,\\n     no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I\\'ve told you all I\\n     know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have\\n     a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up,\\n     for I want to go to Halle\\'s concert to hear Norman Neruda this\\n     afternoon.\"\\n\\n     This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its\\n     way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In\\n     the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a\\n     stand. \"That\\'s Audley Court in there,\" he said, pointing to a narrow\\n     slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. \"You\\'ll find me here when\\n     you come back.\"\\n\\n     Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led\\n     us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings.\\n     We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines\\n     of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which\\n     was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\\n     engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we\\n     were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\\n\\n     He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed\\n     in his slumbers. \"I made my report at the office,\" he said.\\n\\n     Holmes took a half -sovereign from his pocket and played with it\\n     pensively. \"We thought that we should like to hear it all from your\\n     own lips,\" he said.\\n\\n     \"I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\" the constable\\n     answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\\n\\n     \"Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\"\\n\\n     Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\\n     determined not to omit anything in his narrative.\\n\\n     \"I\\'ll tell it ye from the beginning,\" he said. \"My time is from ten\\n     at night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the\\n     \\'White Hart\\'; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one\\n     o\\'clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the\\n     Holland Grove beat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta\\n     Street a-talkin\\'. Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I\\n     thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the\\n     Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet\\n     all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\\'\\n     down, thinkin\\' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot\\n     would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the\\n     window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in\\n     Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who\\n     won\\'t have the drains seed to, though the very last tenant what lived\\n     in one of them died o\\' typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a heap\\n     therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as\\n     something was wrong. When I got to the door--\"\\n\\n     \"You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\" my companion\\n     interrupted. \"What did you do that for?\"\\n\\n     Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the\\n     utmost amazement upon his features.\\n\\n     \"Why, that\\'s true, sir,\" he said; \"though how you come to know it,\\n     Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still\\n     and so lonesome, that I thought I\\'d be none the worse for some one\\n     with me. I ain\\'t afeared of anything on this side o\\' the grave; but I\\n     thought that maybe it was him that died o\\' the typhoid inspecting the\\n     drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\\' turn, and I\\n     walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher\\'s lantern, but\\n     there wasn\\'t no sign of him nor of anyone else.\"\\n\\n     \"There was no one in the street?\"\\n\\n     \"Not a livin\\' soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\\n     together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet\\n     inside, so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin\\'. There\\n     was a candle flickerin\\' on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its\\n     light I saw--\"\\n\\n     \"Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several\\n     times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through\\n     and tried the kitchen door, and then--\"\\n\\n     John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\\n     his eyes. \"Where was you hid to see all that?\" he cried. \"It seems to\\n     me that you knows a deal more than you should.\"\\n\\n     Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\\n     \"Don\\'t get arresting me for the murder,\" he said. \"I am one of the\\n     hounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\\n     that. Go on, though. What did you do next?\"\\n\\n     Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified\\n     expression. \"I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That\\n     brought Murcher and two more to the spot.\"\\n\\n     \"Was the street empty then?\"\\n\\n     \"Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\"\\n\\n     \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n     The constable\\'s features broadened into a grin. \"I\\'ve seen many a\\n     drunk chap in my time,\" he said, \"but never anyone so cryin\\' drunk as\\n     that cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin\\' up ag\\'in the\\n     railings, and a-singin\\' at the pitch o\\' his lungs about Columbine\\'s\\n     New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn\\'t stand, far less\\n     help.\"\\n\\n     \"What sort of a man was he?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n     John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \"He\\n     was an uncommon drunk sort o\\' man,\" he said. \"He\\'d ha\\' found hisself\\n     in the station if we hadn\\'t been so took up.\"\\n\\n     \"His face--his dress--didn\\'t you notice them?\" Holmes broke in\\n     impatiently.\\n\\n     \"I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him\\n     up--me and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face,\\n     the lower part muffled round--\"\\n\\n     \"That will do,\" cried Holmes. \"What became of him?\"\\n\\n     \"We\\'d enough to do without lookin\\' after him,\" the policeman said, in\\n     an aggrieved voice. \"I\\'ll wager he found his way home all right.\"\\n\\n     \"How was he dressed?\"\\n\\n     \"A brown overcoat.\"\\n\\n     \"Had he a whip in  his hand?\"\\n\\n     \"A whip--no.\"\\n\\n     \"He must have left it behind,\" muttered my companion. \"You didn\\'t\\n     happen to see or hear a cab after that?\"\\n\\n     \"No.\"\\n\\n     \"There\\'s a half-sovereign for you,\" my companion said, standing up\\n     and taking his hat. \"I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in\\n     the force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament.\\n     You might have gained your sergeant\\'s stripes last night. The man\\n     whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this\\n     mystery, and whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it\\n     now; I tell you that it is so. Come along, Doctor.\"\\n\\n     We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant\\n     incredulous, but obviously uncomfortable.\\n\\n     \"The blundering fool,\" Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\\n     lodgings. \"Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of\\n     good luck, and not taking advantage of it.\"\\n\\n     \"I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of\\n     this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery.\\n     But why should he come back to the house after leaving it? That is\\n     not the way of criminals.\"\\n\\n     \"The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have\\n     no other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the\\n     ring. I shall have him, Doctor--I\\'ll lay you two to one that I have\\n     him. I must thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you,\\n     and so have missed the finest study I ever came across: a study in\\n     scarlet, eh? Why shouldn\\'t we use a little art jargon. There\\'s the\\n     scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of\\n     life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every\\n     inch of it. And now for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack\\n     and her bowing are splendid. What\\'s that little thing of Chopin\\'s she\\n     plays so magnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\"\\n\\n     Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\\n     lark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER V\\n          Our Advertisement Brings A Visitor\\n\\n\\n     Our morning\\'s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I\\n     was tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes\\' departure for the\\n     concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of\\n     hours\\' sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much\\n     excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and\\n     surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw\\n     before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man.\\n     So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me\\n     that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who\\n     had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke\\n     vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch\\n     J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be\\n     done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the\\n     eyes of the law.\\n\\n     The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\\'s\\n     hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how\\n     he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected\\n     something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not\\n     poison, what had caused the man\\'s death, since there was neither\\n     wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood\\n     was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of\\n     a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have\\n     wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved,\\n     I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or\\n     myself. His quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he had\\n     already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it\\n     was I could not for an instant conjecture.\\n\\n     He was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert\\n     could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table\\n     before he appeared.\\n\\n     \"It was magnificent,\" he said, as he took his seat. \"Do you remember\\n     what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing\\n     and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the\\n     power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly\\n     influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those\\n     misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.\"\\n\\n     \"That\\'s rather a broad idea,\" I remarked.\\n\\n     \"One\\'s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\\n     Nature,\" he answered. \"What\\'s the matter? You\\'re not looking quite\\n     yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\"\\n\\n     \"To tell the truth, it has,\" I said. \"I ought to be more\\n      case-hardened after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades\\n     hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve.\"\\n\\n     \"I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\\n     imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have\\n     you seen the evening paper?\"\\n\\n     \"No.\"\\n\\n     \"It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention\\n     the fact that when the man was raised up, a woman\\'s wedding ring fell\\n     upon the floor. It is just as well it does not.\"\\n\\n     \"Why?\"\\n\\n     \"Look at this advertisement,\" he answered. \"I had one sent to every\\n     paper this morning immediately after the affair.\"\\n\\n     He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated.\\n     It was the first announcement in the \"Found\" column. \"In Brixton\\n     Road, this morning,\" it ran, \"a plain gold wedding ring, found in the\\n     roadway between the \\'White Hart\\' Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr.\\n     Watson, 221b, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.\"\\n\\n     \"Excuse my using your name,\" he said. \"If I used my own some of these\\n     dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.\"\\n\\n     \"That is all right,\" I answered. \"But supposing anyone applies, I\\n     have no ring.\"\\n\\n     \"Oh yes, you have,\" said he, handing me one. \"This will do very well.\\n     It is almost a facsimile.\"\\n\\n     \"And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\"\\n\\n     \"Why, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square\\n     toes. If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\"\\n\\n     \"Would he not consider it as too dangerous?\"\\n\\n     \"Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every\\n     reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything\\n     than lose the ring. According to my notion he dropped it while\\n     stooping over Drebber\\'s body, and did not miss it at the time. After\\n     leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found\\n     the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving\\n     the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay\\n     the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the\\n     gate. Now put yourself in that man\\'s place. On thinking the matter\\n     over, it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had\\n     lost the ring in the road after leaving the house. What would he do,\\n     then? He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of\\n     seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of course, would light\\n     upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There\\n     would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be\\n     connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You shall see\\n     him within an hour.\"\\n\\n     \"And then?\" I asked.\\n\\n     \"Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?\"\\n\\n     \"I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.\"\\n\\n     \"You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and\\n     though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\\n     anything.\"\\n\\n     I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with\\n     the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\\n     favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\\n\\n     \"The plot thickens,\" he said, as I entered; \"I have just had an\\n     answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct\\n     one.\"\\n\\n     \"And that is?\" I asked eagerly.\\n\\n     \"My fiddle would be the better for new strings,\" he remarked. \"Put\\n     your pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an\\n     ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don\\'t frighten him by looking at\\n     him too hard.\"\\n\\n     \"It is eight o\\'clock now,\" I said, glancing at my watch.\\n\\n     \"Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door\\n     slightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you!\\n     This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday--De Jure\\n     inter Gentes--published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642.\\n     Charles\\' head was still firm on his shoulders when this little\\n     brown-backed volume was struck off.\"\\n\\n     \"Who is the printer?\"\\n\\n     \"Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\\n     faded ink, is written \\'Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.\\' I wonder who\\n     William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I\\n     suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man,\\n     I think.\"\\n\\n     As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\\n     softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\\n     servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\\n     opened it.\\n\\n     \"Does Dr. Watson live here?\" asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\\n     could not hear the servant\\'s reply, but the door closed, and some one\\n     began to ascend the stairs. The f',\n",
       " ' led to the chemical\\n     laboratory.\\n\\n     This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\\n     Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\\n     test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering\\n     flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over\\n     a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he\\n     glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \"I\\'ve\\n     found it! I\\'ve found it,\" he shouted to my companion, running towards\\n     us with a test-tube in his hand. \"I have found a re-agent which is\\n     precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else.\" Had he discovered\\n     a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.\\n\\n     \"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Stamford, introducing us.\\n\\n     \"How are you?\" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength\\n     for which I should hardly have given him credit. \"You have been in\\n     Afghanistan, I perceive.\"\\n\\n     \"How on earth did you know that?\" I asked in astonishment.\\n\\n     \"Never mind,\" said he, chuckling to himself. \"The question now is\\n     about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this\\n     discovery of mine?\"\\n\\n     \"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\" I answered, \"but\\n     practically--\"\\n\\n     \"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\\n     Don\\'t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\\n     Come over here now!\" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his\\n     eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been\\n     working. \"Let us have some fresh blood,\" he said, digging a long\\n     bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood\\n     in a chemical pipette. \"Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a\\n     litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the\\n     appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than\\n     one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to\\n     obtain the characteristic reaction.\" As he spoke, he threw into the\\n     vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a\\n     transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany\\n     colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the\\n     glass jar.\\n\\n     \"Ha! ha!\" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\\n     child with a new toy. \"What do you think of that?\"\\n\\n     \"It seems to be a very delicate test,\" I remarked.\\n\\n     \"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\\n     uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles.\\n     The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\\n     appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\\n     been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\\n     would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\"\\n\\n     \"Indeed!\" I murmured.\\n\\n     \"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\\n     suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\\n     linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\\n     them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\\n     stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many\\n     an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have\\n     the Sherlock Holmes\\' test, and there will no longer be any\\n     difficulty.\"\\n\\n     His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\\n     heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\\n     imagination.\\n\\n     \"You are to be congratulated,\" I remarked, considerably surprised at\\n     his enthusiasm.\\n\\n     \"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\\n     certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\\n     was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\\n     Montpellier, and Samson of new Orleans. I could name a score of cases\\n     in which it would have been decisive.\"\\n\\n     \"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\" said Stamford with a\\n     laugh. \"You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the \\'Police\\n     News of the Past.\\'\"\\n\\n     \"Very interesting reading it might be made, too,\" remarked Sherlock\\n     Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his\\n     finger. \"I have to be careful,\" he continued, turning to me with a\\n     smile, \"for I dabble with poisons a good deal.\" He held out his hand\\n     as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar\\n     pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\\n\\n     \"We came here on business,\" said Stamford, sitting down on a high\\n     three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his\\n     foot. \"My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\\n     complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I\\n     thought that I  had better bring you together.\"\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms\\n     with me. \"I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\" he said, \"which\\n     would suit us down to the ground. You don\\'t mind the smell of strong\\n     tobacco, I hope?\"\\n\\n     \"I always smoke \\'ship\\'s\\' myself,\" I answered.\\n\\n     \"That\\'s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and\\n     occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?\"\\n\\n     \"By no means.\"\\n\\n     \"Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\\n     times, and don\\'t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I\\n     am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I\\'ll soon be right.\\n     What have you to confess now? It\\'s just as well for two fellows to\\n     know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.\"\\n\\n     I laughed at this cross-examination. \"I keep a bull pup,\" I said,\\n     \"and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at\\n     all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another\\n     set of vices when I\\'m well, but those are the principal ones at\\n     present.\"\\n\\n     \"Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\" he asked,\\n     anxiously.\\n\\n     \"It depends on the player,\" I answered. \"A well-played violin is a\\n     treat for the gods--a badly-played one--\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, that\\'s all right,\" he cried, with a merry laugh. \"I think we may\\n     consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\\n     you.\"\\n\\n     \"When shall we see them?\"\\n\\n     \"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we\\'ll go together and settle\\n     everything,\" he answered.\\n\\n     \"All right--noon exactly,\" said I, shaking his hand.\\n\\n     We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together\\n     towards my hotel.\\n\\n     \"By the way,\" I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,\\n     \"how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\"\\n\\n     My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \"That\\'s just his little\\n     peculiarity,\" he said. \"A good many people have wanted to know how he\\n     finds things out.\"\\n\\n     \"Oh! a mystery is it?\" I cried, rubbing my hands. \"This is very\\n     piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. \\'The\\n     proper study of mankind is man,\\' you know.\"\\n\\n     \"You must study him, then,\" Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\\n     \"You\\'ll find him a knotty problem, though. I\\'ll wager he learns more\\n     about you than you about him. Good-bye.\"\\n\\n     \"Good-bye,\" I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\\n     interested in my new acquaintance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER II\\n          The Science Of Deduction\\n\\n\\n     We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\\n     221b, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\\n     consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large\\n     airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\\n     windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so\\n     moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain\\n     was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.\\n     That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\\n     following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\\n     portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking\\n     and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we\\n     gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our\\n     new surroundings.\\n\\n     Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet\\n     in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be\\n     up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\\n     before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\\n     chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\\n     occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the\\n     lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the\\n     working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize\\n     him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the\\n     sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning\\n     to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant\\n     expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being\\n     addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and\\n     cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\\n\\n     As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\\n     aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\\n     appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\\n     observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\\n     lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp\\n     and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\\n     alluded; and his t hin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an\\n     air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\\n     squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\\n     invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\\n     possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\\n     occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile\\n     philosophical instruments.\\n\\n     The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\\n     much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to\\n     break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\\n     himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\\n     objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\\n     attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\\n     was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\\n     and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\\n     circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around\\n     my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel\\n     it.\\n\\n     He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\\n     confirmed Stamford\\'s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear\\n     to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a\\n     degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him\\n     an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies\\n     was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so\\n     extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly\\n     astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\\n     information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory\\n     readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No\\n     man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good\\n     reason for doing so.\\n\\n     His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\\n     literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to\\n     nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest\\n     way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a\\n     climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of\\n     the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System.\\n     That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not\\n     be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me\\n     such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\\n\\n     \"You appear to be astonished,\" he said, smiling at my expression of\\n     surprise. \"Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\"\\n\\n     \"To forget it!\"\\n\\n     \"You see,\" he explained, \"I consider that a man\\'s brain originally is\\n     like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such\\n     furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort\\n     that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to\\n     him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other\\n     things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now\\n     the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into\\n     his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help\\n     him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and\\n     all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that\\n     little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend\\n     upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you\\n     forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest\\n     importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the\\n     useful ones.\"\\n\\n     \"But the Solar System!\" I protested.\\n\\n     \"What the deuce is it to me?\" he interrupted impatiently; \"you say\\n     that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make\\n     a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\"\\n\\n     I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but\\n     something in his manner showed me that the question would be an\\n     unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and\\n     endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would\\n     acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore\\n     all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to\\n     him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he\\n     had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a\\n     pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document\\n     when I had completed it. It ran in this way--\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes--his limits.\\n     \\n     1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil.\\n     2. Philosophy.--Nil.\\n     3. Astronomy.--Nil.\\n     4. Politics.--Feeble.\\n     5. Botany.--Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons\\n      generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.\\n     6. Geology.--Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different\\n     soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his\\n     trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of\\n     London he had received them.\\n     7. Chemistry.--Profound.\\n     8. Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic.\\n     9. Sensational Literature.--Immense. He appears to know every detail\\n     of every horror perpetrated in the century.\\n     10. Plays the violin well.\\n     11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\\n     12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\\n\\n     When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\\n     \"If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\\n     these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them\\n     all,\" I said to myself, \"I may as well give up the attempt at once.\"\\n\\n     I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\\n     were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other\\n     accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I\\n     knew well, because at my request he has played me some of\\n     Mendelssohn\\'s Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself,\\n     however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized\\n     air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his\\n     eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his\\n     knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally\\n     they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts\\n     which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or\\n     whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more\\n     than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these\\n     exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by\\n     playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a\\n     slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.\\n\\n     During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to\\n     think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself.\\n     Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those\\n     in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow\\n     rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade,\\n     and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a\\n     young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour\\n     or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor,\\n     looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and\\n     who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman. On another\\n     occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my\\n     companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform.\\n     When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance,\\n     Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I\\n     would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me for putting\\n     me to this inconvenience. \"I have to use this room as a place of\\n     business,\" he said, \"and these people are my clients.\" Again I had an\\n     opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my\\n     delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I\\n     imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding\\n     to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject\\n     of his own accord.\\n\\n     It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that\\n     I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes\\n     had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so\\n     accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my\\n     coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang\\n     the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked\\n     up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time\\n     with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the\\n     articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to\\n     run my eye through it.\\n\\n     Its somewhat ambitious title was \"The Book of Life,\" and it attempted\\n     to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and\\n     systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as\\n     being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The\\n     reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to\\n     be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary\\n     expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a\\n     man\\'s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\\n     in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His\\n     conclusions were as infallible as so many propos itions of Euclid. So\\n     startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they\\n     learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well\\n     consider him as a necromancer.\\n\\n     \"From a drop of water,\" said the writer, \"a logician could infer the\\n     possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard\\n     of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of\\n     which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all\\n     other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can\\n     only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to\\n     allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it.\\n     Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which\\n     present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by\\n     mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a\\n     fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the\\n     man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such\\n     an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and\\n     teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man\\'s finger\\n     nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the\\n     callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his\\n     shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man\\'s calling is plainly\\n     revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent\\n     enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\"\\n\\n     \"What ineffable twaddle!\" I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\\n     table, \"I never read such rubbish in my life.\"\\n\\n     \"What is it?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n     \"Why, this article,\" I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I\\n     sat down to my breakfast. \"I see that you have read it since you have\\n     marked it. I don\\'t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me\\n     though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who\\n     evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own\\n     study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in\\n     a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the\\n     trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one\\n     against him.\"\\n\\n     \"You would lose your money,\" Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly.  \"As\\n     for the article I wrote it myself.\"\\n\\n     \"You!\"\\n\\n     \"Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\\n     theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be\\n     so chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I\\n     depend upon them for my bread and cheese.\"\\n\\n     \"And how?\" I asked involuntarily.\\n\\n     \"Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\\n     world. I\\'m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that\\n     is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of\\n     private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I\\n     manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence\\n     before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of\\n     the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family\\n     resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a\\n     thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can\\'t unravel the\\n     thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got\\n     himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what\\n     brought him here.\"\\n\\n     \"And these other people?\"\\n\\n     \"They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all\\n     people who are in trouble about something, and want a little\\n     enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments,\\n     and then I pocket my fee.\"\\n\\n     \"But do you mean to say,\" I said, \"that without leaving your room you\\n     can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although\\n     they have seen every detail for themselves?\"\\n\\n     \"Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\\n     turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about\\n     and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special\\n     knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters\\n     wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which\\n     aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work.\\n     Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised\\n     when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from\\n     Afghanistan.\"\\n\\n     \"You were told, no doubt.\"\\n\\n     \"Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long\\n     habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\\n     arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate\\n     steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,\\n     \\'Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with ',\n",
       " 'ite muzzle proclaimed that it had already\\n     exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a\\n     cushion on the rug.\\n\\n     \"I will now cut one of these pills in two,\" said Holmes, and drawing\\n     his penknife he suited the action to the word. \"One half we return\\n     into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this\\n     wine glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our\\n     friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\"\\n\\n     \"This may be very interesting,\" said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\\n     one who suspects that he is being laughed at, \"I cannot see, however,\\n     what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\"\\n\\n     \"Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\\n     everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\\n     mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he\\n     laps it up readily enough.\"\\n\\n     As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer\\n     and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry.\\n     Sherlock Holmes\\' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we\\n     all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some\\n     startling effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to\\n     lie stretched upon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but\\n     apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught.\\n\\n     Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\\n     result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment\\n     appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers\\n     upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience.\\n     So great was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while\\n     the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this\\n     check which he had met.\\n\\n     \"It can\\'t be a coincidence,\" he cried, at last springing from his\\n     chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; \"it is impossible that\\n     it should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in\\n     the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson.\\n     And yet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of\\n     reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this\\n     wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\" With a\\n     perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in\\n     two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The\\n     unfortunate creature\\'s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in\\n     it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid\\n     and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.\\n\\n     Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from\\n     his forehead. \"I should have more faith,\" he said; \"I ought to know\\n     by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train\\n     of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some\\n     other interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the\\n     most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to\\n     have known that before ever I saw the box at all.\"\\n\\n     This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\\n     hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead\\n     dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It\\n     seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing\\n     away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\\n\\n     \"All this seems strange to you,\" continued Holmes, \"because you\\n     failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the\\n     single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune\\n     to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has\\n     served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the\\n     logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and\\n     made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to\\n     strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness\\n     with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious\\n     because it presents no new or special features from which deductions\\n     may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult\\n     to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the\\n     roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments\\n     which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from\\n     making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making\\n     it less so.\"\\n\\n     Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\\n     impatience, could contain himself no longer. \"Look here, Mr. Sherlock\\n     Holmes,\" he said, \"we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a\\n     smart man, and that you have your  own methods of working. We want\\n     something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a\\n     case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was\\n     wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second\\n     affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that\\n     he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there,\\n     and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel\\n     that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the\\n     business. Can you name the man who did it?\"\\n\\n     \"I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\" remarked\\n     Lestrade. \"We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have\\n     remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had\\n     all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it\\n     any longer.\"\\n\\n     \"Any delay in arresting the assassin,\" I observed, \"might give him\\n     time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\"\\n\\n     Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\\n     continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his\\n     chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in\\n     thought.\\n\\n     \"There will be no more murders,\" he said at last, stopping abruptly\\n     and facing us. \"You can put that consideration out of the question.\\n     You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere\\n     knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the\\n     power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do.\\n     I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it\\n     is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and\\n     desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion\\n     to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man\\n     has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of\\n     securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change\\n     his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants\\n     of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings,\\n     I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match\\n     for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your\\n     assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to\\n     this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to\\n     promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without\\n     endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.\"\\n\\n     Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this\\n     assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police.\\n     The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the\\n     other\\'s beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither\\n     of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the\\n     door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins,\\n     introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.\\n\\n     \"Please, sir,\" he said, touching his forelock, \"I have the cab\\n     downstairs.\"\\n\\n     \"Good boy,\" said Holmes, blandly. \"Why don\\'t you introduce this\\n     pattern at Scotland Yard?\" he continued, taking a pair of steel\\n     handcuffs from a drawer. \"See how beautifully the spring works. They\\n     fasten in an instant.\"\\n\\n     \"The old pattern is good enough,\" remarked Lestrade, \"if we can only\\n     find the man to put them on.\"\\n\\n     \"Very good, very good,\" said Holmes, smiling. \"The cabman may as well\\n     help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\"\\n\\n     I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\\n     to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about\\n     it. There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out\\n     and began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman\\n     entered the room.\\n\\n     \"Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\" he said, kneeling\\n     over his task, and never turning his head.\\n\\n     The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\\n     down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click,\\n     the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\\n\\n     \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, with flashing eyes, \"let me introduce you to\\n     Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph\\n     Stangerson.\"\\n\\n     The whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time\\n     to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of\\n     Holmes\\' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the\\n     cabman\\'s dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering\\n     handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a\\n     second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with an\\n     inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from\\n     Holmes\\'s grasp, and hurled hims elf through the window. Woodwork and\\n     glass gave way before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson,\\n     Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was\\n     dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict.\\n     So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us were shaken off\\n     again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man\\n     in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled by his\\n     passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in\\n     diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in\\n     getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we\\n     made him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then\\n     we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his\\n     hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting.\\n\\n     \"We have his cab,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"It will serve to take him\\n     to Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\" he continued, with a pleasant\\n     smile, \"we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very\\n     welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no\\n     danger that I will refuse to answer them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      PART II\\n\\n                           The Country of the Saints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          CHAPTER I\\n          On The Great Alkali Plain\\n\\n\\n     In the central portion of the great North American Continent there\\n     lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served\\n     as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra\\n     Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to\\n     the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence.\\n     Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It\\n     comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy\\n     valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged\\n     cañons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with\\n     snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all\\n     preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness,\\n     inhospitality, and misery.\\n\\n     There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees\\n     or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\\n     hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose\\n     sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon\\n     their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps\\n     heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through\\n     the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the\\n     rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\\n\\n     In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from\\n     the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\\n     stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\\n     alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes.\\n     On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain\\n     peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great\\n     stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything\\n     appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no\\n     movement upon the dull, grey earth--above all, there is absolute\\n     silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that\\n     mighty wilderness; nothing but silence--complete and heart-subduing\\n     silence.\\n\\n     It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\\n     plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\\n     sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\\n     lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden\\n     down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are\\n     scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out\\n     against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They\\n     are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate.\\n     The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen\\n     hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these\\n     scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.\\n\\n     Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\\n     eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His\\n     appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon\\n     of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say\\n     whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and\\n     haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the\\n     projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and\\n     dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with\\n     an unnatur al lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was\\n     hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned\\n     upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive\\n     framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution.\\n     His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over\\n     his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that\\n     senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying--dying from hunger\\n     and from thirst.\\n\\n     He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\\n     elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the\\n     great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of\\n     savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which\\n     might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape\\n     there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with\\n     wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had\\n     come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to\\n     die. \"Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\"\\n     he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\\n\\n     Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless\\n     rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had\\n     carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too\\n     heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the\\n     ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey\\n     parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small,\\n     scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled,\\n     dimpled fists.\\n\\n     \"You\\'ve hurt me!\" said a childish voice reproachfully.\\n\\n     \"Have I though,\" the man answered penitently, \"I didn\\'t go for to do\\n     it.\" As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\\n     little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\\n     pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother\\'s care.\\n     The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that\\n     she had suffered less than her companion.\\n\\n     \"How is it now?\" he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\\n     towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\\n\\n     \"Kiss it and make it well,\" she said, with perfect gravity, shoving\\n     the injured part up to him. \"That\\'s what mother used to do. Where\\'s\\n     mother?\"\\n\\n     \"Mother\\'s gone. I guess you\\'ll see her before long.\"\\n\\n     \"Gone, eh!\" said the little girl. \"Funny, she didn\\'t say good-bye;\\n     she \\'most always did if she was just goin\\' over to Auntie\\'s for tea,\\n     and now she\\'s been away three days. Say, it\\'s awful dry, ain\\'t it?\\n     Ain\\'t there no water, nor nothing to eat?\"\\n\\n     \"No, there ain\\'t nothing, dearie. You\\'ll just need to be patient\\n     awhile, and then you\\'ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like\\n     that, and then you\\'ll feel bullier. It ain\\'t easy to talk when your\\n     lips is like leather, but I guess I\\'d best let you know how the cards\\n     lie. What\\'s that you\\'ve got?\"\\n\\n     \"Pretty things! fine things!\" cried the little girl enthusiastically,\\n     holding up two glittering fragments of mica. \"When we goes back to\\n     home I\\'ll give them to brother Bob.\"\\n\\n     \"You\\'ll see prettier things than them soon,\" said the man\\n     confidently. \"You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you\\n     though--you remember when we left the river?\"\\n\\n     \"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n     \"Well, we reckoned we\\'d strike another river soon, d\\'ye see. But\\n     there was somethin\\' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin\\', and it\\n     didn\\'t turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the\\n     likes of you and--and--\"\\n\\n     \"And you couldn\\'t wash yourself,\" interrupted his companion gravely,\\n     staring up at his grimy visage.\\n\\n     \"No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then\\n     Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then,\\n     dearie, your mother.\"\\n\\n     \"Then mother\\'s a deader too,\" cried the little girl dropping her face\\n     in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\\n\\n     \"Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\\n     chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder\\n     and we tramped it together. It don\\'t seem as though we\\'ve improved\\n     matters. There\\'s an almighty small chance for us now!\"\\n\\n     \"Do you mean that we are going to die too?\" asked the child, checking\\n     her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\\n\\n     \"I guess that\\'s about the size of it.\"\\n\\n     \"Why didn\\'t you say so before?\" she said, laughing gleefully. \"You\\n     gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we\\'ll be\\n     with mother again.\"\\n\\n     \"Yes, you will, dearie.\"\\n\\n     \"And you too. I\\'ll tell her how awful good you\\'ve been. I\\'ll bet she\\n     meets us at the door of Heaven with a big  pitcher of water, and a lot\\n     of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me\\n     was fond of. How long will it be first?\"\\n\\n     \"I don\\'t know--not very long.\" The man\\'s eyes were fixed upon the\\n     northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\\n     three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly\\n     did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large\\n     brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and\\n     then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were\\n     buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of\\n     death.\\n\\n     \"Cocks and hens,\" cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\\n     ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \"Say, did\\n     God make this country?\"\\n\\n     \"Of course He did,\" said her companion, rather startled by this\\n     unexpected question.\\n\\n     \"He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\" the\\n     little girl continued. \"I guess somebody else made the country in\\n     these parts. It\\'s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and\\n     the trees.\"\\n\\n     \"What would ye think of offering up prayer?\" the man asked\\n     diffidently.\\n\\n     \"It ain\\'t night yet,\" she answered.\\n\\n     \"It don\\'t matter. It ain\\'t quite regular, but He won\\'t mind that, you\\n     bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\\n     waggon when we was on the Plains.\"\\n\\n     \"Why don\\'t you say some yourself?\" the child asked, with wondering\\n     eyes.\\n\\n     \"I disremember them,\" he answered. \"I hain\\'t said none since I was\\n     half the height o\\' that gun. I guess it\\'s never too late. You say\\n     them out, and I\\'ll stand by and come in on the choruses.\"\\n\\n     \"Then you\\'ll need to kneel down, and me too,\" she said, laying the\\n     shawl out for that purpose. \"You\\'ve got to put your hands up like\\n     this. It makes you feel kind o\\' good.\"\\n\\n     It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to\\n     see it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the\\n     little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her\\n     chubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to\\n     the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with\\n     whom they were face to face, while the two voices--the one thin and\\n     clear, the other deep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and\\n     forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the\\n     shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the\\n     broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some\\n     time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and\\n     three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly\\n     the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and\\n     lower upon the breast, until the man\\'s grizzled beard was mixed with\\n     the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and\\n     dreamless slumber.\\n\\n     Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\\n     would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\\n     plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\\n     hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but\\n     gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid,\\n     well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it\\n     became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of\\n     moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come\\n     to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze\\n     upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously\\n     impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to\\n     the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the\\n     canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen\\n     began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself\\n     as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a\\n     caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains,\\n     the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the\\n     enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men\\n     on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along\\n     under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped\\n     out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary\\n     party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been\\n     compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new\\n     country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and\\n     rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of\\n     wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not\\n     sufficient to rouse the two ti']"

       "'You are an expert in Sherlock Holmes novels. Use the following references from the supplied novel to answer my question at the end.\\n    Reference = [\\'enius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\" he\\\\n     remarked with a smile. \"It\\\\\\'s a very bad definition, but it does apply\\\\n     to detective work.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres of their amateur\\\\n     companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They\\\\n     evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to\\\\n     realize, that Sherlock Holmes\\\\\\' smallest actions were all directed\\\\n     towards some definite and practical end.\\\\n\\\\n     \"What do you think of it, sir?\" they both asked.\\\\n\\\\n     \"It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to\\\\n     presume to help you,\" remarked my friend. \"You are doing so well now\\\\n     that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.\" There was a world\\\\n     of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \"If you will let me know how\\\\n     your investigations go,\" he continued, \"I shall be happy to give you\\\\n     any help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the\\\\n     constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and address?\"\\\\n\\\\n     Lestrade glanced at his note-book. \"John Rance,\" he said. \"He is off\\\\n     duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park\\\\n     Gate.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Holmes took a note of the address.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Come along, Doctor,\" he said; \"we shall go and look him up. I\\\\\\'ll\\\\n     tell you one thing which may help you in the case,\" he continued,\\\\n     turning to the two detectives. \"There has been murder done, and the\\\\n     murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime\\\\n     of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed\\\\n     boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim\\\\n     in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old\\\\n     shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability the\\\\n     murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand\\\\n     were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may\\\\n     assist you.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\\\\n\\\\n     \"If this man was murdered, how was it done?\" asked the former.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Poison,\" said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \"One other\\\\n     thing, Lestrade,\" he added, turning round at the door: \"\\\\\\'Rache,\\\\\\' is\\\\n     the German for \\\\\\'revenge;\\\\\\' so don\\\\\\'t lose your time looking for Miss\\\\n     Rachel.\"\\\\n\\\\n     With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\\\\n     open-mouthed behind him. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          CHAPTER IV\\\\n          What John Rance Had To Tell\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n     It was one o\\\\\\'clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\\\\n     Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\\\\n     long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take\\\\n     us to the address given us by Lestrade.\\\\n\\\\n     \"There is nothing like first hand evidence,\" he remarked; \"as a\\\\n     matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still\\\\n     we may as well learn all that is to be learned.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"You amaze me, Holmes,\" said I. \"Surely you are not as sure as you\\\\n     pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"There\\\\\\'s no room for a mistake,\" he answered. \"The very first thing\\\\n     which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts\\\\n     with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had\\\\n     no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep\\\\n     impression must have been there during the night. There were the\\\\n     marks of the horse\\\\\\'s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far\\\\n     more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was\\\\n     a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not\\\\n     there at any time during the morning--I have Gregson\\\\\\'s word for\\\\n     that--it follows that it must have been there during the night, and,\\\\n     therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"That seems simple enough,\" said I; \"but how about the other man\\\\\\'s\\\\n     height?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\\\\n     the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\\\\n     there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\\\\\\'s\\\\n     stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a\\\\n     way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his\\\\n     instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that\\\\n     writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child\\\\\\'s play.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"And his age?\" I asked.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\\\\n     effort, he can\\\\\\'t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the\\\\n     breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked\\\\n     across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had\\\\n     hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply\\\\n     applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and\\\\n     deduction which I advocated in that  article. Is there anything else\\\\n     that puzzles you?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\" I suggested.\\\\n\\\\n     \"The writing on the wall was done with a man\\\\\\'s forefinger dipped in\\\\n     blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\\\\n     scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the\\\\n     man\\\\\\'s nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from\\\\n     the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only\\\\n     made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar\\\\n     ashes--in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I\\\\n     flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any\\\\n     known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such\\\\n     details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and\\\\n     Lestrade type.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"And the florid face?\" I asked.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\\\\n     right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\"\\\\n\\\\n     I passed my hand over my brow. \"My head is in a whirl,\" I remarked;\\\\n     \"the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came\\\\n     these two men--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has\\\\n     become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another\\\\n     to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of\\\\n     the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman\\\\\\'s\\\\n     ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German\\\\n     word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible\\\\n     way of reconciling all these facts.\"\\\\n\\\\n     My companion smiled approvingly.\\\\n\\\\n     \"You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\"\\\\n     he said. \"There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite\\\\n     made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\\\\\\'s discovery it\\\\n     was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by\\\\n     suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a\\\\n     German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German\\\\n     fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character,\\\\n     so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a\\\\n     clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert\\\\n     inquiry into a wrong channel. I\\\\\\'m not going to tell you much more of\\\\n     the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has\\\\n     explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of\\\\n     working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary\\\\n     individual after all.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"I shall never do that,\" I answered; \"you have brought detection as\\\\n     near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\"\\\\n\\\\n     My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest\\\\n     way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as\\\\n     sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of\\\\n     her beauty.\\\\n\\\\n     \"I\\\\\\'ll tell you one other thing,\" he said. \"Patent-leathers and\\\\n     Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\\\\n     together as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.\\\\n     When they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather,\\\\n     Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\\\\n     could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked\\\\n     he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length\\\\n     of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up,\\\\n     no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I\\\\\\'ve told you all I\\\\n     know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have\\\\n     a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up,\\\\n     for I want to go to Halle\\\\\\'s concert to hear Norman Neruda this\\\\n     afternoon.\"\\\\n\\\\n     This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its\\\\n     way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In\\\\n     the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a\\\\n     stand. \"That\\\\\\'s Audley Court in there,\" he said, pointing to a narrow\\\\n     slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. \"You\\\\\\'ll find me here when\\\\n     you come back.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led\\\\n     us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings.\\\\n     We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines\\\\n     of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which\\\\n     was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\\\\n     engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we\\\\n     were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\\\\n\\\\n     He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed\\\\n     in his slumbers. \"I made my report at the office,\" he said.\\\\n\\\\n     Holmes took a half -sovereign from his pocket and played with it\\\\n     pensively. \"We thought that we should like to hear it all from your\\\\n     own lips,\" he said.\\\\n\\\\n     \"I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\" the constable\\\\n     answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\\\\n     determined not to omit anything in his narrative.\\\\n\\\\n     \"I\\\\\\'ll tell it ye from the beginning,\" he said. \"My time is from ten\\\\n     at night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the\\\\n     \\\\\\'White Hart\\\\\\'; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one\\\\n     o\\\\\\'clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the\\\\n     Holland Grove beat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta\\\\n     Street a-talkin\\\\\\'. Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I\\\\n     thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the\\\\n     Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet\\\\n     all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\\\\\\'\\\\n     down, thinkin\\\\\\' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot\\\\n     would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the\\\\n     window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in\\\\n     Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who\\\\n     won\\\\\\'t have the drains seed to, though the very last tenant what lived\\\\n     in one of them died o\\\\\\' typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a heap\\\\n     therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as\\\\n     something was wrong. When I got to the door--\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\" my companion\\\\n     interrupted. \"What did you do that for?\"\\\\n\\\\n     Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the\\\\n     utmost amazement upon his features.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Why, that\\\\\\'s true, sir,\" he said; \"though how you come to know it,\\\\n     Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still\\\\n     and so lonesome, that I thought I\\\\\\'d be none the worse for some one\\\\n     with me. I ain\\\\\\'t afeared of anything on this side o\\\\\\' the grave; but I\\\\n     thought that maybe it was him that died o\\\\\\' the typhoid inspecting the\\\\n     drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\\\\\\' turn, and I\\\\n     walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher\\\\\\'s lantern, but\\\\n     there wasn\\\\\\'t no sign of him nor of anyone else.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"There was no one in the street?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Not a livin\\\\\\' soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\\\\n     together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet\\\\n     inside, so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin\\\\\\'. There\\\\n     was a candle flickerin\\\\\\' on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its\\\\n     light I saw--\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several\\\\n     times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through\\\\n     and tried the kitchen door, and then--\"\\\\n\\\\n     John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\\\\n     his eyes. \"Where was you hid to see all that?\" he cried. \"It seems to\\\\n     me that you knows a deal more than you should.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\\\\n     \"Don\\\\\\'t get arresting me for the murder,\" he said. \"I am one of the\\\\n     hounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\\\\n     that. Go on, though. What did you do next?\"\\\\n\\\\n     Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified\\\\n     expression. \"I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That\\\\n     brought Murcher and two more to the spot.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Was the street empty then?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"What do you mean?\"\\\\n\\\\n     The constable\\\\\\'s features broadened into a grin. \"I\\\\\\'ve seen many a\\\\n     drunk chap in my time,\" he said, \"but never anyone so cryin\\\\\\' drunk as\\\\n     that cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin\\\\\\' up ag\\\\\\'in the\\\\n     railings, and a-singin\\\\\\' at the pitch o\\\\\\' his lungs about Columbine\\\\\\'s\\\\n     New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn\\\\\\'t stand, far less\\\\n     help.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"What sort of a man was he?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n     John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \"He\\\\n     was an uncommon drunk sort o\\\\\\' man,\" he said. \"He\\\\\\'d ha\\\\\\' found hisself\\\\n     in the station if we hadn\\\\\\'t been so took up.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"His face--his dress--didn\\\\\\'t you notice them?\" Holmes broke in\\\\n     impatiently.\\\\n\\\\n     \"I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him\\\\n     up--me and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face,\\\\n     the lower part muffled round--\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"That will do,\" cried Holmes. \"What became of him?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"We\\\\\\'d enough to do without lookin\\\\\\' after him,\" the policeman said, in\\\\n     an aggrieved voice. \"I\\\\\\'ll wager he found his way home all right.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"How was he dressed?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"A brown overcoat.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Had he a whip in  his hand?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"A whip--no.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"He must have left it behind,\" muttered my companion. \"You didn\\\\\\'t\\\\n     happen to see or hear a cab after that?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"No.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"There\\\\\\'s a half-sovereign for you,\" my companion said, standing up\\\\n     and taking his hat. \"I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in\\\\n     the force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament.\\\\n     You might have gained your sergeant\\\\\\'s stripes last night. The man\\\\n     whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this\\\\n     mystery, and whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it\\\\n     now; I tell you that it is so. Come along, Doctor.\"\\\\n\\\\n     We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant\\\\n     incredulous, but obviously uncomfortable.\\\\n\\\\n     \"The blundering fool,\" Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\\\\n     lodgings. \"Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of\\\\n     good luck, and not taking advantage of it.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of\\\\n     this man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery.\\\\n     But why should he come back to the house after leaving it? That is\\\\n     not the way of criminals.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have\\\\n     no other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the\\\\n     ring. I shall have him, Doctor--I\\\\\\'ll lay you two to one that I have\\\\n     him. I must thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you,\\\\n     and so have missed the finest study I ever came across: a study in\\\\n     scarlet, eh? Why shouldn\\\\\\'t we use a little art jargon. There\\\\\\'s the\\\\n     scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of\\\\n     life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every\\\\n     inch of it. And now for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack\\\\n     and her bowing are splendid. What\\\\\\'s that little thing of Chopin\\\\\\'s she\\\\n     plays so magnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\\\\n     lark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          CHAPTER V\\\\n          Our Advertisement Brings A Visitor\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n     Our morning\\\\\\'s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I\\\\n     was tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes\\\\\\' departure for the\\\\n     concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of\\\\n     hours\\\\\\' sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much\\\\n     excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and\\\\n     surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw\\\\n     before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man.\\\\n     So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me\\\\n     that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who\\\\n     had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke\\\\n     vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch\\\\n     J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be\\\\n     done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonement in the\\\\n     eyes of the law.\\\\n\\\\n     The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\\\\\\'s\\\\n     hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how\\\\n     he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected\\\\n     something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not\\\\n     poison, what had caused the man\\\\\\'s death, since there was neither\\\\n     wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood\\\\n     was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of\\\\n     a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have\\\\n     wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved,\\\\n     I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or\\\\n     myself. His quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he had\\\\n     already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it\\\\n     was I could not for an instant conjecture.\\\\n\\\\n     He was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert\\\\n     could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table\\\\n     before he appeared.\\\\n\\\\n     \"It was magnificent,\" he said, as he took his seat. \"Do you remember\\\\n     what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing\\\\n     and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the\\\\n     power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly\\\\n     influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those\\\\n     misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"That\\\\\\'s rather a broad idea,\" I remarked.\\\\n\\\\n     \"One\\\\\\'s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\\\\n     Nature,\" he answered. \"What\\\\\\'s the matter? You\\\\\\'re not looking quite\\\\n     yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"To tell the truth, it has,\" I said. \"I ought to be more\\\\n      case-hardened after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades\\\\n     hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\\\\n     imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have\\\\n     you seen the evening paper?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"No.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention\\\\n     the fact that when the man was raised up, a woman\\\\\\'s wedding ring fell\\\\n     upon the floor. It is just as well it does not.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Why?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Look at this advertisement,\" he answered. \"I had one sent to every\\\\n     paper this morning immediately after the affair.\"\\\\n\\\\n     He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated.\\\\n     It was the first announcement in the \"Found\" column. \"In Brixton\\\\n     Road, this morning,\" it ran, \"a plain gold wedding ring, found in the\\\\n     roadway between the \\\\\\'White Hart\\\\\\' Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr.\\\\n     Watson, 221b, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Excuse my using your name,\" he said. \"If I used my own some of these\\\\n     dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"That is all right,\" I answered. \"But supposing anyone applies, I\\\\n     have no ring.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Oh yes, you have,\" said he, handing me one. \"This will do very well.\\\\n     It is almost a facsimile.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Why, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square\\\\n     toes. If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Would he not consider it as too dangerous?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every\\\\n     reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything\\\\n     than lose the ring. According to my notion he dropped it while\\\\n     stooping over Drebber\\\\\\'s body, and did not miss it at the time. After\\\\n     leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found\\\\n     the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving\\\\n     the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay\\\\n     the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the\\\\n     gate. Now put yourself in that man\\\\\\'s place. On thinking the matter\\\\n     over, it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had\\\\n     lost the ring in the road after leaving the house. What would he do,\\\\n     then? He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of\\\\n     seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of course, would light\\\\n     upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There\\\\n     would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be\\\\n     connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You shall see\\\\n     him within an hour.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"And then?\" I asked.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and\\\\n     though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\\\\n     anything.\"\\\\n\\\\n     I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with\\\\n     the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\\\\n     favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\\\\n\\\\n     \"The plot thickens,\" he said, as I entered; \"I have just had an\\\\n     answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct\\\\n     one.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"And that is?\" I asked eagerly.\\\\n\\\\n     \"My fiddle would be the better for new strings,\" he remarked. \"Put\\\\n     your pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an\\\\n     ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don\\\\\\'t frighten him by looking at\\\\n     him too hard.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"It is eight o\\\\\\'clock now,\" I said, glancing at my watch.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door\\\\n     slightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you!\\\\n     This is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday--De Jure\\\\n     inter Gentes--published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642.\\\\n     Charles\\\\\\' head was still firm on his shoulders when this little\\\\n     brown-backed volume was struck off.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Who is the printer?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\\\\n     faded ink, is written \\\\\\'Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.\\\\\\' I wonder who\\\\n     William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I\\\\n     suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man,\\\\n     I think.\"\\\\n\\\\n     As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\\\\n     softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\\\\n     servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\\\\n     opened it.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Does Dr. Watson live here?\" asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\\\\n     could not hear the servant\\\\\\'s reply, but the door closed, and some one\\\\n     began to ascend the stairs. The f\\', \\' led to the chemical\\\\n     laboratory.\\\\n\\\\n     This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\\\\n     Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\\\\n     test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering\\\\n     flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over\\\\n     a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he\\\\n     glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \"I\\\\\\'ve\\\\n     found it! I\\\\\\'ve found it,\" he shouted to my companion, running towards\\\\n     us with a test-tube in his hand. \"I have found a re-agent which is\\\\n     precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else.\" Had he discovered\\\\n     a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Stamford, introducing us.\\\\n\\\\n     \"How are you?\" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength\\\\n     for which I should hardly have given him credit. \"You have been in\\\\n     Afghanistan, I perceive.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"How on earth did you know that?\" I asked in astonishment.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Never mind,\" said he, chuckling to himself. \"The question now is\\\\n     about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this\\\\n     discovery of mine?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\" I answered, \"but\\\\n     practically--\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\\\\n     Don\\\\\\'t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.\\\\n     Come over here now!\" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his\\\\n     eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been\\\\n     working. \"Let us have some fresh blood,\" he said, digging a long\\\\n     bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood\\\\n     in a chemical pipette. \"Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a\\\\n     litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the\\\\n     appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than\\\\n     one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to\\\\n     obtain the characteristic reaction.\" As he spoke, he threw into the\\\\n     vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a\\\\n     transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany\\\\n     colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the\\\\n     glass jar.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Ha! ha!\" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\\\\n     child with a new toy. \"What do you think of that?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"It seems to be a very delicate test,\" I remarked.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\\\\n     uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles.\\\\n     The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this\\\\n     appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test\\\\n     been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who\\\\n     would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Indeed!\" I murmured.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\\\\n     suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\\\\n     linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon\\\\n     them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit\\\\n     stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many\\\\n     an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have\\\\n     the Sherlock Holmes\\\\\\' test, and there will no longer be any\\\\n     difficulty.\"\\\\n\\\\n     His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\\\\n     heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\\\\n     imagination.\\\\n\\\\n     \"You are to be congratulated,\" I remarked, considerably surprised at\\\\n     his enthusiasm.\\\\n\\\\n     \"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\\\\n     certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\\\\n     was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\\\\n     Montpellier, and Samson of new Orleans. I could name a score of cases\\\\n     in which it would have been decisive.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\" said Stamford with a\\\\n     laugh. \"You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the \\\\\\'Police\\\\n     News of the Past.\\\\\\'\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Very interesting reading it might be made, too,\" remarked Sherlock\\\\n     Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his\\\\n     finger. \"I have to be careful,\" he continued, turning to me with a\\\\n     smile, \"for I dabble with poisons a good deal.\" He held out his hand\\\\n     as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar\\\\n     pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.\\\\n\\\\n     \"We came here on business,\" said Stamford, sitting down on a high\\\\n     three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his\\\\n     foot. \"My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\\\\n     complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I\\\\n     thought that I  had better bring you together.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms\\\\n     with me. \"I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\" he said, \"which\\\\n     would suit us down to the ground. You don\\\\\\'t mind the smell of strong\\\\n     tobacco, I hope?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"I always smoke \\\\\\'ship\\\\\\'s\\\\\\' myself,\" I answered.\\\\n\\\\n     \"That\\\\\\'s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and\\\\n     occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"By no means.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\\\\n     times, and don\\\\\\'t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I\\\\n     am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I\\\\\\'ll soon be right.\\\\n     What have you to confess now? It\\\\\\'s just as well for two fellows to\\\\n     know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.\"\\\\n\\\\n     I laughed at this cross-examination. \"I keep a bull pup,\" I said,\\\\n     \"and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at\\\\n     all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another\\\\n     set of vices when I\\\\\\'m well, but those are the principal ones at\\\\n     present.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\" he asked,\\\\n     anxiously.\\\\n\\\\n     \"It depends on the player,\" I answered. \"A well-played violin is a\\\\n     treat for the gods--a badly-played one--\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Oh, that\\\\\\'s all right,\" he cried, with a merry laugh. \"I think we may\\\\n     consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\\\\n     you.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"When shall we see them?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we\\\\\\'ll go together and settle\\\\n     everything,\" he answered.\\\\n\\\\n     \"All right--noon exactly,\" said I, shaking his hand.\\\\n\\\\n     We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together\\\\n     towards my hotel.\\\\n\\\\n     \"By the way,\" I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,\\\\n     \"how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\"\\\\n\\\\n     My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \"That\\\\\\'s just his little\\\\n     peculiarity,\" he said. \"A good many people have wanted to know how he\\\\n     finds things out.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Oh! a mystery is it?\" I cried, rubbing my hands. \"This is very\\\\n     piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. \\\\\\'The\\\\n     proper study of mankind is man,\\\\\\' you know.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"You must study him, then,\" Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\\\\n     \"You\\\\\\'ll find him a knotty problem, though. I\\\\\\'ll wager he learns more\\\\n     about you than you about him. Good-bye.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Good-bye,\" I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\\\\n     interested in my new acquaintance.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          CHAPTER II\\\\n          The Science Of Deduction\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n     We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\\\\n     221b, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\\\\n     consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large\\\\n     airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\\\\n     windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so\\\\n     moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain\\\\n     was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.\\\\n     That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\\\\n     following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\\\\n     portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking\\\\n     and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we\\\\n     gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our\\\\n     new surroundings.\\\\n\\\\n     Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet\\\\n     in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be\\\\n     up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\\\\n     before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the\\\\n     chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and\\\\n     occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the\\\\n     lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the\\\\n     working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize\\\\n     him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the\\\\n     sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning\\\\n     to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant\\\\n     expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being\\\\n     addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and\\\\n     cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\\\\n\\\\n     As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\\\\n     aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\\\\n     appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\\\\n     observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\\\\n     lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp\\\\n     and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\\\\n     alluded; and his t hin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an\\\\n     air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\\\\n     squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\\\\n     invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was\\\\n     possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had\\\\n     occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile\\\\n     philosophical instruments.\\\\n\\\\n     The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\\\\n     much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to\\\\n     break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\\\\n     himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\\\\n     objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my\\\\n     attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather\\\\n     was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me\\\\n     and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these\\\\n     circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around\\\\n     my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel\\\\n     it.\\\\n\\\\n     He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\\\\n     confirmed Stamford\\\\\\'s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear\\\\n     to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a\\\\n     degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him\\\\n     an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies\\\\n     was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so\\\\n     extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly\\\\n     astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise\\\\n     information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory\\\\n     readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No\\\\n     man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good\\\\n     reason for doing so.\\\\n\\\\n     His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\\\\n     literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to\\\\n     nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest\\\\n     way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a\\\\n     climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of\\\\n     the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System.\\\\n     That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not\\\\n     be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me\\\\n     such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\\\\n\\\\n     \"You appear to be astonished,\" he said, smiling at my expression of\\\\n     surprise. \"Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"To forget it!\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"You see,\" he explained, \"I consider that a man\\\\\\'s brain originally is\\\\n     like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such\\\\n     furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort\\\\n     that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to\\\\n     him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other\\\\n     things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now\\\\n     the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into\\\\n     his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help\\\\n     him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and\\\\n     all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that\\\\n     little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend\\\\n     upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you\\\\n     forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest\\\\n     importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the\\\\n     useful ones.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"But the Solar System!\" I protested.\\\\n\\\\n     \"What the deuce is it to me?\" he interrupted impatiently; \"you say\\\\n     that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make\\\\n     a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\"\\\\n\\\\n     I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but\\\\n     something in his manner showed me that the question would be an\\\\n     unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and\\\\n     endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would\\\\n     acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore\\\\n     all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to\\\\n     him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he\\\\n     had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a\\\\n     pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document\\\\n     when I had completed it. It ran in this way--\\\\n\\\\n     Sherlock Holmes--his limits.\\\\n     \\\\n     1.

Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\\\\n\\\\n     When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\\\\n     \"If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\\\\n     these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them\\\\n     all,\" I said to myself, \"I may as well give up the attempt at once.\"\\\\n\\\\n     I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\\\\n     were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other\\\\n     accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I\\\\n     knew well, because at my request he has played me some of\\\\n     Mendelssohn\\\\\\'s Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself,\\\\n     however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized\\\\n     air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his\\\\n     eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his\\\\n     knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally\\\\n     they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts\\\\n     which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or\\\\n     whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more\\\\n     than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these\\\\n     exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by\\\\n     playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a\\\\n     slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.\\\\n\\\\n     During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to\\\\n     think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself.\\\\n     Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those\\\\n     in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow\\\\n     rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade,\\\\n     and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a\\\\n     young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour\\\\n     or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor,\\\\n     looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and\\\\n     who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman. On another\\\\n     occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my\\\\n     companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform.\\\\n     When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance,\\\\n     Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I\\\\n     would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me for putting\\\\n     me to this inconvenience. \"I have to use this room as a place of\\\\n     business,\" he said, \"and these people are my clients.\" Again I had an\\\\n     opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my\\\\n     delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I\\\\n     imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding\\\\n     to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject\\\\n     of his own accord.\\\\n\\\\n     It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that\\\\n     I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes\\\\n     had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so\\\\n     accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my\\\\n     coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang\\\\n     the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked\\\\n     up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time\\\\n     with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the\\\\n     articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to\\\\n     run my eye through it.\\\\n\\\\n     Its somewhat ambitious title was \"The Book of Life,\" and it attempted\\\\n     to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and\\\\n     systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as\\\\n     being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The\\\\n     reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to\\\\n     be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary\\\\n     expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a\\\\n     man\\\\\\'s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility\\\\n     in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His\\\\n     conclusions were as infallible as so many propos itions of Euclid. So\\\\n     startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they\\\\n     learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well\\\\n     consider him as a necromancer.\\\\n\\\\n     \"From a drop of water,\" said the writer, \"a logician could infer the\\\\n     possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard\\\\n     of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of\\\\n     which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all\\\\n     other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can\\\\n     only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to\\\\n     allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it.\\\\n     Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which\\\\n     present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by\\\\n     mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a\\\\n     fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the\\\\n     man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such\\\\n     an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and\\\\n     teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man\\\\\\'s finger\\\\n     nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the\\\\n     callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his\\\\n     shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man\\\\\\'s calling is plainly\\\\n     revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent\\\\n     enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"What ineffable twaddle!\" I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\\\\n     table, \"I never read such rubbish in my life.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"What is it?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Why, this article,\" I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I\\\\n     sat down to my breakfast. \"I see that you have read it since you have\\\\n     marked it. I don\\\\\\'t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me\\\\n     though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who\\\\n     evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own\\\\n     study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in\\\\n     a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the\\\\n     trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one\\\\n     against him.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"You would lose your money,\" Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly.  \"As\\\\n     for the article I wrote it myself.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"You!\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\\\\n     theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be\\\\n     so chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I\\\\n     depend upon them for my bread and cheese.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"And how?\" I asked involuntarily.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\\\\n     world. I\\\\\\'m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that\\\\n     is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of\\\\n     private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I\\\\n     manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence\\\\n     before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of\\\\n     the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family\\\\n     resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a\\\\n     thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can\\\\\\'t unravel the\\\\n     thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got\\\\n     himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what\\\\n     brought him here.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"And these other people?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all\\\\n     people who are in trouble about something, and want a little\\\\n     enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments,\\\\n     and then I pocket my fee.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"But do you mean to say,\" I said, \"that without leaving your room you\\\\n     can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although\\\\n     they have seen every detail for themselves?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\\\\n     turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about\\\\n     and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special\\\\n     knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters\\\\n     wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which\\\\n     aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work.\\\\n     Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised\\\\n     when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from\\\\n     Afghanistan.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"You were told, no doubt.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long\\\\n     habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\\\\n     arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate\\\\n     steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,\\\\n     \\\\\\'Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with \\', \\'ite muzzle proclaimed that it had already\\\\n     exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a\\\\n     cushion on the rug.\\\\n\\\\n     \"I will now cut one of these pills in two,\" said Holmes, and drawing\\\\n     his penknife he suited the action to the word. \"One half we return\\\\n     into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this\\\\n     wine glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our\\\\n     friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"This may be very interesting,\" said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\\\\n     one who suspects that he is being laughed at, \"I cannot see, however,\\\\n     what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\\\\n     everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\\\\n     mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he\\\\n     laps it up readily enough.\"\\\\n\\\\n     As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer\\\\n     and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry.\\\\n     Sherlock Holmes\\\\\\' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we\\\\n     all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some\\\\n     startling effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to\\\\n     lie stretched upon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but\\\\n     apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught.\\\\n\\\\n     Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\\\\n     result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment\\\\n     appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers\\\\n     upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience.\\\\n     So great was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while\\\\n     the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this\\\\n     check which he had met.\\\\n\\\\n     \"It can\\\\\\'t be a coincidence,\" he cried, at last springing from his\\\\n     chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; \"it is impossible that\\\\n     it should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in\\\\n     the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson.\\\\n     And yet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of\\\\n     reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this\\\\n     wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\" With a\\\\n     perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in\\\\n     two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The\\\\n     unfortunate creature\\\\\\'s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in\\\\n     it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid\\\\n     and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.\\\\n\\\\n     Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from\\\\n     his forehead. \"I should have more faith,\" he said; \"I ought to know\\\\n     by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train\\\\n     of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some\\\\n     other interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the\\\\n     most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to\\\\n     have known that before ever I saw the box at all.\"\\\\n\\\\n     This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\\\\n     hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead\\\\n     dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It\\\\n     seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing\\\\n     away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\\\\n\\\\n     \"All this seems strange to you,\" continued Holmes, \"because you\\\\n     failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the\\\\n     single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune\\\\n     to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has\\\\n     served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the\\\\n     logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and\\\\n     made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to\\\\n     strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness\\\\n     with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious\\\\n     because it presents no new or special features from which deductions\\\\n     may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult\\\\n     to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the\\\\n     roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments\\\\n     which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from\\\\n     making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making\\\\n     it less so.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\\\\n     impatience, could contain himself no longer. \"Look here, Mr. Sherlock\\\\n     Holmes,\" he said, \"we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a\\\\n     smart man, and that you have your  own methods of working. We want\\\\n     something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a\\\\n     case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was\\\\n     wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second\\\\n     affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that\\\\n     he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there,\\\\n     and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel\\\\n     that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the\\\\n     business. Can you name the man who did it?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\" remarked\\\\n     Lestrade. \"We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have\\\\n     remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had\\\\n     all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it\\\\n     any longer.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Any delay in arresting the assassin,\" I observed, \"might give him\\\\n     time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\\\\n     continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his\\\\n     chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in\\\\n     thought.\\\\n\\\\n     \"There will be no more murders,\" he said at last, stopping abruptly\\\\n     and facing us. \"You can put that consideration out of the question.\\\\n     You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere\\\\n     knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the\\\\n     power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do.\\\\n     I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it\\\\n     is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and\\\\n     desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion\\\\n     to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man\\\\n     has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of\\\\n     securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change\\\\n     his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants\\\\n     of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings,\\\\n     I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match\\\\n     for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your\\\\n     assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to\\\\n     this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to\\\\n     promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without\\\\n     endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.\"\\\\n\\\\n     Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this\\\\n     assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police.\\\\n     The former had flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the\\\\n     other\\\\\\'s beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither\\\\n     of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the\\\\n     door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins,\\\\n     introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Please, sir,\" he said, touching his forelock, \"I have the cab\\\\n     downstairs.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Good boy,\" said Holmes, blandly. \"Why don\\\\\\'t you introduce this\\\\n     pattern at Scotland Yard?\" he continued, taking a pair of steel\\\\n     handcuffs from a drawer. \"See how beautifully the spring works. They\\\\n     fasten in an instant.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"The old pattern is good enough,\" remarked Lestrade, \"if we can only\\\\n     find the man to put them on.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Very good, very good,\" said Holmes, smiling. \"The cabman may as well\\\\n     help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\"\\\\n\\\\n     I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\\\\n     to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about\\\\n     it. There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out\\\\n     and began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman\\\\n     entered the room.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\" he said, kneeling\\\\n     over his task, and never turning his head.\\\\n\\\\n     The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\\\\n     down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click,\\\\n     the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, with flashing eyes, \"let me introduce you to\\\\n     Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph\\\\n     Stangerson.\"\\\\n\\\\n     The whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time\\\\n     to realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of\\\\n     Holmes\\\\\\' triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the\\\\n     cabman\\\\\\'s dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering\\\\n     handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a\\\\n     second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with an\\\\n     inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from\\\\n     Holmes\\\\\\'s grasp, and hurled hims elf through the window. Woodwork and\\\\n     glass gave way before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson,\\\\n     Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was\\\\n     dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict.\\\\n     So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us were shaken off\\\\n     again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man\\\\n     in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled by his\\\\n     passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in\\\\n     diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in\\\\n     getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we\\\\n     made him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then\\\\n     we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his\\\\n     hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting.\\\\n\\\\n     \"We have his cab,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"It will serve to take him\\\\n     to Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\" he continued, with a pleasant\\\\n     smile, \"we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very\\\\n     welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no\\\\n     danger that I will refuse to answer them.\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n                                      PART II\\\\n\\\\n                           The Country of the Saints.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          CHAPTER I\\\\n          On The Great Alkali Plain\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n     In the central portion of the great North American Continent there\\\\n     lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served\\\\n     as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra\\\\n     Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to\\\\n     the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence.\\\\n     Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It\\\\n     comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy\\\\n     valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged\\\\n     cañons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with\\\\n     snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all\\\\n     preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness,\\\\n     inhospitality, and misery.\\\\n\\\\n     There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees\\\\n     or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\\\\n     hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose\\\\n     sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon\\\\n     their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps\\\\n     heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through\\\\n     the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the\\\\n     rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\\\\n\\\\n     In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from\\\\n     the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\\\\n     stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\\\\n     alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes.\\\\n     On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain\\\\n     peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great\\\\n     stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything\\\\n     appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no\\\\n     movement upon the dull, grey earth--above all, there is absolute\\\\n     silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that\\\\n     mighty wilderness; nothing but silence--complete and heart-subduing\\\\n     silence.\\\\n\\\\n     It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\\\\n     plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\\\\n     sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\\\\n     lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden\\\\n     down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are\\\\n     scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out\\\\n     against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They\\\\n     are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate.\\\\n     The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen\\\\n     hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these\\\\n     scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.\\\\n\\\\n     Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\\\\n     eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His\\\\n     appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon\\\\n     of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say\\\\n     whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and\\\\n     haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the\\\\n     projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and\\\\n     dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with\\\\n     an unnatur al lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was\\\\n     hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned\\\\n     upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive\\\\n     framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution.\\\\n     His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over\\\\n     his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that\\\\n     senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying--dying from hunger\\\\n     and from thirst.\\\\n\\\\n     He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\\\\n     elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the\\\\n     great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of\\\\n     savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which\\\\n     might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape\\\\n     there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with\\\\n     wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had\\\\n     come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to\\\\n     die. \"Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\"\\\\n     he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\\\\n\\\\n     Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless\\\\n     rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had\\\\n     carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too\\\\n     heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the\\\\n     ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey\\\\n     parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small,\\\\n     scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled,\\\\n     dimpled fists.\\\\n\\\\n     \"You\\\\\\'ve hurt me!\" said a childish voice reproachfully.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Have I though,\" the man answered penitently, \"I didn\\\\\\'t go for to do\\\\n     it.\" As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\\\\n     little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\\\\n     pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother\\\\\\'s care.\\\\n     The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that\\\\n     she had suffered less than her companion.\\\\n\\\\n     \"How is it now?\" he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\\\\n     towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Kiss it and make it well,\" she said, with perfect gravity, shoving\\\\n     the injured part up to him. \"That\\\\\\'s what mother used to do. Where\\\\\\'s\\\\n     mother?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Mother\\\\\\'s gone. I guess you\\\\\\'ll see her before long.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Gone, eh!\" said the little girl. \"Funny, she didn\\\\\\'t say good-bye;\\\\n     she \\\\\\'most always did if she was just goin\\\\\\' over to Auntie\\\\\\'s for tea,\\\\n     and now she\\\\\\'s been away three days. Say, it\\\\\\'s awful dry, ain\\\\\\'t it?\\\\n     Ain\\\\\\'t there no water, nor nothing to eat?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"No, there ain\\\\\\'t nothing, dearie. You\\\\\\'ll just need to be patient\\\\n     awhile, and then you\\\\\\'ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like\\\\n     that, and then you\\\\\\'ll feel bullier. It ain\\\\\\'t easy to talk when your\\\\n     lips is like leather, but I guess I\\\\\\'d best let you know how the cards\\\\n     lie. What\\\\\\'s that you\\\\\\'ve got?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Pretty things! fine things!\" cried the little girl enthusiastically,\\\\n     holding up two glittering fragments of mica. \"When we goes back to\\\\n     home I\\\\\\'ll give them to brother Bob.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"You\\\\\\'ll see prettier things than them soon,\" said the man\\\\n     confidently. \"You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you\\\\n     though--you remember when we left the river?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Oh, yes.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Well, we reckoned we\\\\\\'d strike another river soon, d\\\\\\'ye see. But\\\\n     there was somethin\\\\\\' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin\\\\\\', and it\\\\n     didn\\\\\\'t turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the\\\\n     likes of you and--and--\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"And you couldn\\\\\\'t wash yourself,\" interrupted his companion gravely,\\\\n     staring up at his grimy visage.\\\\n\\\\n     \"No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then\\\\n     Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then,\\\\n     dearie, your mother.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Then mother\\\\\\'s a deader too,\" cried the little girl dropping her face\\\\n     in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\\\\n     chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder\\\\n     and we tramped it together. It don\\\\\\'t seem as though we\\\\\\'ve improved\\\\n     matters. There\\\\\\'s an almighty small chance for us now!\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Do you mean that we are going to die too?\" asked the child, checking\\\\n     her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\\\\n\\\\n     \"I guess that\\\\\\'s about the size of it.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Why didn\\\\\\'t you say so before?\" she said, laughing gleefully. \"You\\\\n     gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we\\\\\\'ll be\\\\n     with mother again.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Yes, you will, dearie.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"And you too. I\\\\\\'ll tell her how awful good you\\\\\\'ve been. I\\\\\\'ll bet she\\\\n     meets us at the door of Heaven with a big  pitcher of water, and a lot\\\\n     of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me\\\\n     was fond of. How long will it be first?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"I don\\\\\\'t know--not very long.\" The man\\\\\\'s eyes were fixed upon the\\\\n     northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\\\\n     three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly\\\\n     did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large\\\\n     brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and\\\\n     then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were\\\\n     buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of\\\\n     death.\\\\n\\\\n     \"Cocks and hens,\" cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\\\\n     ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \"Say, did\\\\n     God make this country?\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Of course He did,\" said her companion, rather startled by this\\\\n     unexpected question.\\\\n\\\\n     \"He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\" the\\\\n     little girl continued. \"I guess somebody else made the country in\\\\n     these parts. It\\\\\\'s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and\\\\n     the trees.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"What would ye think of offering up prayer?\" the man asked\\\\n     diffidently.\\\\n\\\\n     \"It ain\\\\\\'t night yet,\" she answered.\\\\n\\\\n     \"It don\\\\\\'t matter. It ain\\\\\\'t quite regular, but He won\\\\\\'t mind that, you\\\\n     bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\\\\n     waggon when we was on the Plains.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Why don\\\\\\'t you say some yourself?\" the child asked, with wondering\\\\n     eyes.\\\\n\\\\n     \"I disremember them,\" he answered. \"I hain\\\\\\'t said none since I was\\\\n     half the height o\\\\\\' that gun. I guess it\\\\\\'s never too late. You say\\\\n     them out, and I\\\\\\'ll stand by and come in on the choruses.\"\\\\n\\\\n     \"Then you\\\\\\'ll need to kneel down, and me too,\" she said, laying the\\\\n     shawl out for that purpose. \"You\\\\\\'ve got to put your hands up like\\\\n     this. It makes you feel kind o\\\\\\' good.\"\\\\n\\\\n     It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to\\\\n     see it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the\\\\n     little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her\\\\n     chubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to\\\\n     the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with\\\\n     whom they were face to face, while the two voices--the one thin and\\\\n     clear, the other deep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and\\\\n     forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the\\\\n     shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the\\\\n     broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some\\\\n     time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and\\\\n     three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly\\\\n     the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and\\\\n     lower upon the breast, until the man\\\\\\'s grizzled beard was mixed with\\\\n     the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and\\\\n     dreamless slumber.\\\\n\\\\n     Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\\\\n     would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\\\\n     plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\\\\n     hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but\\\\n     gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid,\\\\n     well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it\\\\n     became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of\\\\n     moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come\\\\n     to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze\\\\n     upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously\\\\n     impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to\\\\n     the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the\\\\n     canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen\\\\n     began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself\\\\n     as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a\\\\n     caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains,\\\\n     the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the\\\\n     enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men\\\\n     on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along\\\\n     under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped\\\\n     out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary\\\\n     party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been\\\\n     compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new\\\\n     country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and\\\\n     rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of\\\\n     wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not\\\\n     sufficient to rouse the two ti\\'] Here is the question: What did watson say at the end of the novel?'"
